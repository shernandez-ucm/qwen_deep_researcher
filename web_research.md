The research aims to assess and evaluate artificial intelligence integration in various library services and operations, identifying training and institutional gaps and exploring librarians’ future perspectives on impact of GenAI in the libraries and their roles. The research employs a descriptive quantitative approach using an online survey targeting librarians working across higher education in the GCC region. The structured survey included questions related to demography, multiple choice responses for selection of AI tools and the application of these tools, and a Likert scale involving construct on measuring AI adoptions, training requirements, challenges and future perspective on GenAI technologies. A total of 160 participants were included in the study and various statistical analysis such as descriptive analysis, independent sample T-test and one way ANOVA tests were conducted to identify the key trends and group differences. The key finding revealed a widespread adoption of generative AI technologies with ChatGPT, Google, Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot being the most frequently used. The study found that librarians were using GenAI tools for various services including answering research queries, summarizing articles, research writing, information retrieval, and enhancing library services. Regardless of high adoption rates, the study highlights significant gaps in training and institutional support for AI technologies, with many librarians relying on self-based training to upskill themselves due to lack of structure AI training programs and institutional support. A country wise analysis revealed UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have made substantial investments in AI training and infrastructure whereas Oman, Bahrain, and Kuwait are lagging. Key challenges include AI content accuracy, data privacy concerns, ethical risks such as bias and plagiarism. The study also found some gender related significant differences primarily related to their tasks. Despite the concerns related to the changing role of librarians and job loss, librarians in GCC reflected a positive and optimistic attitude despite toward AI applications in library and expected strong support from institutions in terms of investment in training and infrastructure for AI technologies. The study provides deep insights into the current state of GenAI adoption in universities libraries across the GCC region, highlighting the regional disparities in AI training and institutional support. It contributes toward the growing literature on AI literacy in Library & information science and offers practical recommendations for academic institutions, policymakers and library & information science professionals to bridge the gap in artificial intelligence skills and competencies and foster responsible use of AI integration in library services.\n===\nFull source content limited to 1000 tokens: This study explores the adoption, applications, usage, training, challenges, and future perception of generative artificial intelligence tools among university librarians in the GCC region.

A comprehensive data survey involved 206 respondents from various academic and professional backgrounds. The survey explored the factors influencing the use and acceptance of GenAI tools within educational contexts. To analyze the data and predict user behavior and usage patterns, a machine learning algorithm random forest regressor, was utilized using Python. Firstly, the composite artificial intelligence adoption index has been developed to investigate how individuals adopt and integrate GenAI into their routine academic usage. Secondly, three thematic dimensions of GenAI usage have been identified as cognitive benefit score, writing benefit score, and information benefit score, which are presumed to be the most important part of AIAI. Furthermore, Pearson correlation coefficient and heat map, along with statistical p-value significance, were generated to understand the association among the AI adoption index and the three thematic dimensions. There exists strong evidence that perceived cognitive benefits are the primary drivers of AI adoption, followed by writing and information gathering benefits. The predictive models generated helped identify trends and provide insights into how generative AI could be leveraged more effectively in educational settings, offering valuable recommendations for both educators and policymakers.\n===\nFull source content limited to 1000 tokens: This study investigates the key drivers behind the adoption and integration of generative AI technologies, such as ChatGPT, in higher education.

Despite its growing adoption, the evolution of CRM research in HEIs, including key contributors, dominant themes, and emerging trends, remains underexplored. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of Scopus-indexed publications (2014–2024) to map the intellectual landscape of CRM research in higher education. Using Biblioshiny with Bibliometrix version 4.0 and VOSviewer version 1.6.20, this study analyzes publication trends, influential authors and institutions, keyword networks, and thematic developments. The findings indicate a transition from early research on service quality and academic reputation to advanced themes such as AI-driven CRM strategies, multi-channel communication, and social media analytics. While the United Kingdom, India, and Indonesia emerge as leading contributors, gaps persist in cross-cultural CRM applications, the integration of emerging technologies, and the development of standardized evaluation frameworks. This study contributes to CRM scholarship by mapping research trajectories, identifying underexplored areas, and offering actionable insights for future studies. It highlights the expanding role of CRM beyond student engagement, encompassing education quality, labor market, employment growth, technological progress and AI-driven decision-making. These findings emphasize the need for interdisciplinary approaches and robust academic performance to maximize CRM’s strategic potential in higher education.\n===\nFull source content limited to 1000 tokens: Customer relationship management (CRM) has become a critical strategy for higher education institutions (HEIs) to enhance student engagement, institutional efficiency, and digital transformation.

The study aims to analyze the scientific and conceptual development of generative artificial intelligence in higher education to identify the most relevant transversal competencies, strategic processes for its sustainable implementation, and global trends in academic production. A systematic literature review (PRISMA) was conducted on the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed, analyzing 35 studies for narrative synthesis and 897 publications for bibliometric analysis. The transversal competencies identified were: Academic Integrity, Critical Thinking, Innovation, Ethics, Creativity, Communication, Collaboration, AI Literacy, Responsibility, Digital Literacy, AI Ethics, Autonomous Learning, Self-Regulation, Flexibility, and Leadership. The conceptual framework connotes the interdisciplinary nature and five key processes were identified to achieve the sustainable integration of Generative AI in higher education oriented to the development of transversal competencies: (1) critical and ethical appropriation, (2) institutional management of technological infrastructure, (3) faculty development, (4) curricular transformation, and (5) pedagogical innovation. On bibliometric behavior, scientific articles predominate, with few systematic reviews. China leads in publication volume, and social sciences are the most prominent area. It is concluded that generative artificial intelligence is key to the development of transversal competencies if it is adopted from a critical, ethical, and pedagogically intentional approach.
